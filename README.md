<h1>Design Patterns in Java</h1>

<p>This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java, along with additional practice code for personal learning and experimentation.</p>
<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and scalability. This repository offers implementations of key design patterns, each explained with examples.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Factory: Provides an interface for creating objects, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects.</li>
  <li>Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.</li>
  <li>Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.</li>
  <li>Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.</li>
  <li>Observer: Defines one-to-many dependencies between objects to notify state changes.</li>
  <li>Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class.</li>
</ul>
